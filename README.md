# AGRICULTURE-COMMODITY-PRICE-FORECASTING-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
The project plays a crucial role in decision-making for farmers, traders, policymakers, and investors in the agricultural sector. Traditional time series forecasting
methods often struggle to capture the complex nonlinear relationships and dynamic
patterns inherent in agriculture commodity price data. In recent years, deep learning
models have emerged as powerful tools for handling such complexities and achieving
superior forecasting accuracy. This project aims to develop and evaluate deep learning models for agriculture commodity prices forecasting. Specifically, 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),Bidirectional
Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
and their variants will be employed to analyze historical price data of various agriculture commodities. The project will explore different architectures and training
strategies to optimize the models’ performance. Key steps of the project include data
preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, validation, and evaluation.Collaboration with domain experts, including agricultural economists, traders,
and policymakers, will be vital throughout the project to ensure that the developed
models address real-world challenges and meet the needs of end-users effectively.
Through rigorous experimentation and validation, this project aims to establish deep
learning as a viable and effective approach for agriculture commodity price forecasting, paving the way for more informed decision-making and sustainable agricultural
practices Additionally, techniques such as transfer learning and ensemble methods
will be investigated to enhance forecasting accuracy further. The models will be
evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The project’s
findings will contribute to the existing literature on agriculture commodity prices
forecasting and provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture industry.
By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to improve the accuracy
and reliability of agriculture commodity price forecasts, ultimately facilitating more
informed decision-making and risk management in the agricultural sector.
